# Product-analysis (SQL)
The "Product Analysis" project focuses on analyzing customer transactions to gain insights into product preferences, sales performance, and customer behavior. By leveraging a relational database consisting of three interrelated tables—Customers, Transactions, and Product Category Info—key metrics were derived to aid in data-driven decision-making.
## Project Objectives:
1.	To analyze customer demographics and understand purchasing behavior.
2.	To identify top-performing product categories and subcategories.
3.	To evaluate sales trends across different store types and locations.
4.	To provide actionable insights for improving product offerings and sales strategies.

## Project Process:
1.	Data Collection & Setup:
-	Designed and populated relational tables in MySQL to simulate real-world e-commerce or retail data.
2.	Data Exploration:
-	Used SQL queries to clean, filter, and join the data for exploration.
-	Analyzed customer demographics like age groups and gender preferences.
3.	Data Analysis:
-	Identified top product categories, subcategories, and their contribution to revenue.
-	Evaluated transaction trends by date, store type, and city.
-	Calculated average transaction value, tax impact, and sales by customer segments.
4.	Insight Derivation:
-	Segmented customers by purchase frequency and product preferences.
-	Uncovered seasonal trends in product sales.
-	Evaluated how product subcategories performed across different cities and store types.
